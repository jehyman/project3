frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game: Game Instructions
==========================================

To run this game on your computer, you first need to transfer the files to your local machine.
This can be done by either of the following:

1.  Download the zip file, and unzip it on your computer.
2.  If you have Git Bash on your local machine, you can “clone” the app on your machine.  This can be done on the Git Bash command line by using 
“git clone https://github.com/jehyman/project3.git” to clone the app files to your “home” directory.  The “home” directory is the “user” directory in Windows.

If you go to the directory “project3” into which your files were copied, you can run the app, in Windows, by dragging and dropping the file “index.html” into an open browser.

Here are the rules for playing the game:
The objective of the game is to unite the two lovers. The active lover starts on the safety of the grass field.  The active lover can be moved, one cell at a time, by using the arrow keys: “left”, “right”, “up”, and “down”.  The passive lover waits, without moving, in the safety of the river.  In my interpretation of the game, water is "safe" for both lovers.  After all, the game is called “Frogger”, and frogs love water.  The active lover must traverse three dangerous roads filled with enemy bugs who will destroy the lover on contact and end the game.  To win, the active lover must arrive in the same cell as the passive lover.  You can play as many new games as you like.  So that the game will not be sexist, you can choose, in the "setting" tab, either the male, the "boy", or the female, the "princess", to be the active lover.  Have fun, and be careful on the roads!
